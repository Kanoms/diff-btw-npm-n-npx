`npm` and `npx` are both command-line tools used for working with Node.js packages, but they serve different purposes.

`npm` is the Node.js package manager used to install and manage packages in a project. It downloads packages from the npm registry and installs them in the local `node_modules` directory of a project. `npm` also allows developers to manage dependencies, run scripts, publish packages, and more.

`npx` is a tool that allows developers to execute packages from the npm registry without having to install them globally or locally. It allows developers to run command-line tools and scripts without installing them first. When `npx` is used to run a package, it downloads the latest version of the package from the npm registry, executes it, and then removes it.

In summary, `npm` is used to manage and install packages, while `npx` is used to run command-line tools and scripts without installing them first.
